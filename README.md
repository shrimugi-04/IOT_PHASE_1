Project Definition: The project involves implementing IoT sensors to monitor water consumption in public places such as parks and gardens. The objective is to promote water conservation by making real-time water consumption data publicly available. This project includes defining objectives, designing the IoT sensor system, developing the data-sharing platform, and integrating them using IoT technology and Python.
PROBLEM IDEA : Internet of Things has been associated with cities, smart homes and also to manage traffic system. A unknown fact that about internet of things technology is also application across many other fields in our everyday life. Another such area where the internet of things technology can play a major role in water management. IOT is evolving fast and latest innovation occurring in wireless technology and embedded technology. This work focuses on a solution for water management in colleges, building and commercial area with the help of IOT. Water is precious and supply the needs to be regulated. To maintain the water in a proper way, should prevent the overflow of water in tanks and usage of the water in proper manner. In traditional days there is no proper maintenance of water. In conventional tanks there is need of human being to ON/OFF the motor. In this paper the automated system is introduced which is used to save the human work and cost. In this system the motor is automatically ON/OFF by using level sensor. The usage of water is observed by the water flow sensor 

DESIGN THINKING : Water is the most important need for all living beings. This project helps to regulate the proper maintenance of water tank using IOT. Water management problems such as water usage ,water consumption in public places such as parks , gardens  , overflow in the water tank .To overcome this problem by implementing proper monitoring and information updation system along with awareness among public.
  Ultrasonic sensor is used to indicate the level of water in real time. When the water level falls below the threshold level the motor will automatically ON and alerts the respected authority. Temperature sensor is used to sense the temperature in the water tank. Water flow sensor is used to know the usage of water litre per hour. By using ESP8266 WI-FI module the data is recorded in real time and updated in cloud. 
            The level of water in the tank by using the ultrasonic sensor and can reduce overflow of the water.
               The usage of the water in the tank can be used to control the wastage of the water.     
              To know the temperature in the water tank in real time

PROJECT TITLE : SMART WATER MANAGEMENT 
 

Transforming the design concept for IoT-based smart water management in public places into a real-world project involves several key steps. Here's a detailed process:

1. Project Objectives Definition:
  Objective Setting: The first step is to clearly define the project's objectives. In this case, the primary objective is to promote water conservation by monitoring and providing real-time water consumption data for public places like parks and gardens.
  Scope  :Determination of  the scope of the project, including the specific areas or locations where IoT sensors will be deployed, the level of data granularity required, and the expected outcomes.
   Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Establishing several  KPIs to measure the success of , such as reduced water consumption, cost savings, and improved sustainability.
2. IoT Sensor System Design with hardware selection :
 Sensor Selection: Choose appropriate IoT sensors for monitoring water consumption. For water management, , the sensors and meters  which are needed are flow meters, pressure sensors, and water quality sensors.
   Ultrasonic Sensors: Place ultrasonic sensors at water storage tanks or sources to measure water levels. These sensors can help track the quantity of water available.
   Water Sensors: Install water sensors at various points in the irrigation system to detect water flow and detect any leaks or abnormal water usage.
   Temperature Sensors: Usage temperature sensors to monitor environmental conditions that may affect water requirements for irrigation.
  Reset Logic: Implement reset logic to ensure the system remains responsive and accurate. This may involve periodic calibration and maintenance routines.
Relay Power: Using of  relay modules to control the water pumps or valves. These can be activated or deactivated based on sensor data.
 ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module: Integratation of the ESP8266 module for wireless communication and data transfer to the central platform.
Oscillator: Utilize an oscillator for precise timekeeping and synchronization of data transmission.
Sensor Placement: Determining the optimal locations for sensor deployment to ensure accurate data collection. The  factors that are needed to be considered are water pipes, accessibility, and environmental conditions.
 Communication Protocol:  The suitable communication protocol is MQTT, HTTP, LoRaWAN for data transmission from sensors to the central platform.
Power Source :The power source for the sensors which is going to be used is  battery-powered or wired depending on the deployment locations.
3.Power supply : 
    A stable and reliable power supply is essential for your IoT system. Here's how you can ensure a proper power supply:
1. Battery Backup: To ensure continuous operation, we are using a combination of mains power and battery backup. This is crucial in case of power outages. Utilize rechargeable batteries to keep the system running during disruptions.
2. Solar Power: If  IoT sensors are deployed in outdoor locations like parks and gardens, solar panels are used for sustainable and efficient power source. They can charge the backup batteries and power the system during the day.
3. Energy-Efficient Components: Select energy-efficient sensors and microcontrollers to reduce power consumption. Inactive components should be put into low-power sleep modes when not in use.
4. Power Management Circuitry: Implement power management circuitry to regulate and distribute power to various components. This includes voltage regulators, battery charging circuits, and power control systems.
5. Redundancy: To ensure system reliability, consider redundant power supplies. If one power source fails, another can take over to keep the system operational. 


4. IoT Sensor Development:
